## What is this
Just a small demo to show how to use [Angular2](https://angular.io/) + [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) + 
[Google Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) together. Currently
this demo application contains following features:
 * Social media login (Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and GitHub)
 * Personal 'Todo' item list
 * Chat with other users
 
## Demo
Demo of this application can be found from [https://dodz.com.br/](https://dodz.com.br/).

## Installation
First of all you have to install <code>npm</code> and <code>node.js</code> to your box. Installation instructions can
be found [here](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager). 

Also note that ```node.js 6.x``` is required.

### Configuration
See ```/src/app/config/config.ts``` file and make necessary changes to it. 
Note that you need a Firebase account to get all necessary config values.

### Firebase
To get Firebase running as it should first you need to make new Firebase application. Which you can create easily from
their website [https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/).

After you have created new application you need to make some [security rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/quickstart) 
for the used data storage. Below is configuration that this demo application uses, so you can use the same within your 
application.

```
{
  "rules": {
    "messages": {
      ".write": "auth !== null",
      ".read": "auth !== null"
    },
    "todos": {
      "$uid": {
        // grants write access to the owner of this user account whose uid must exactly match the key ($uid)
        ".write": "auth !== null && auth.uid === $uid",
        // grants read access to any user who is logged in with Facebook
        ".read": "auth !== null && auth.uid === $uid"
      }
    },
    "posts": {
      "$uid": {
        // grants write access to the owner of this user account whose uid must exactly match the key ($uid)
        ".write": "auth !== null && auth.uid === $uid",
        // grants read access to any user who is logged in with Facebook
        ".read": "auth !== null && auth.uid === $uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

These rules ensure that 'todo' items are show only to user who made those. Also chat messages requires that user is
logged in to read / write those.

## Development

```bash
npm run start
``` 
OR
```bash
ng serve
```

Then head to `http://localhost:4200` in your browser.

## Tests

### Unit tests
To run tests run:
```bash
ng test
```

### e2e tests
To run tests run:
```bash
ng e2e
```

## Build
